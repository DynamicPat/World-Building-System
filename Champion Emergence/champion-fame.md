# Champion Fame

**Fame** represents the **recognition and renown** a champion gains across the world. It measures how widely their name is known, whether through heroic deeds, notorious acts, or legendary status. Fame is the public face of a champion's influence — the stories told in taverns, the songs sung by bards, and the fear or hope their name inspires.

---

## Nature of Fame

Fame is:
- **Reputation at scale**: The breadth and intensity of recognition across communities and realms.
- **Morally neutral**: Fame can come from heroism or villainy; what matters is that the name is known.
- **A social currency**: High Fame opens doors, attracts followers, and influences political power.
- **A double-edged sword**: Fame brings opportunity but also draws enemies, challengers, and unwanted attention.

> "A name spoken in every tavern is a power unto itself — whether blessed or cursed."

## How Fame Accumulates

Fame increases through:

### Public Deeds
- Victories or failures witnessed by others or spread through stories.
- **Scale of audience matters**:
  - Local deed (village/town) → +1 Fame
  - Regional deed (multiple communities/realm) → +2 Fame
  - World-scale deed (multiple realms/epochal event) → +3 to +5 Fame

### Champion Deeds
- Each recorded [Champion Deed](/Champion%20Emergence/champion-deeds.md) typically grants +1 Fame.
- Deeds at higher scales grant proportionally more Fame.

### Cultural Propagation
- **Bards, storytellers, and rumor** spread a champion's name.
- Communities with high Influence or trade connections amplify Fame faster.
- **Story Tokens** tied to the champion can trigger Fame increases when they spread.

### Titles and Recognition
- Gaining formal titles (Knight, General, Saint, Outlaw King) grants +1 to +2 Fame.
- Divine blessing or curse publicly known grants +2 to +3 Fame.

### Artifacts and Symbols
- Wielding a legendary weapon, wearing distinctive armor, or carrying a famous relic adds +1 Fame.
- These become part of the champion's iconography.

### Repeated Appearances
- Champions who consistently appear in public or at pivotal moments gain Fame over time.
- Leading armies, presiding at councils, or performing miracles all build Fame incrementally.

## Managing Fame

### Increasing Fame Intentionally
- **Perform public acts**: Stage challenges, hold festivals, lead armies visibly.
- **Commission art**: Bards, paintings, statues, or monuments spread Fame.
- **Align with institutions**: Join orders, serve realms, or champion causes that amplify reach.

### Reducing Fame
Fame is difficult to reduce but can fade:

#### Obscurity
- Retiring from public life and avoiding deeds reduces Fame slowly over time.
- Each turn of inactivity may reduce Fame by -1 (GM discretion).

#### Disgrace
- A major scandal or failure can reduce Fame by -2 to -5.
- This may convert Fame into **Infamy** (still recognized, but negatively).

#### Death and Myth
- Upon death, Fame may crystallize into **Legacy**:
  - Champions with Fame 12+ become legends, their Fame frozen as cultural memory.
  - Their deeds are retold, shaping future ages and inspiring new champions.

## Fame in Play

### For GMs
- Use Fame to create dynamic NPC reactions — not everyone should treat the champion the same.
- High Fame should open new story opportunities (alliances, quests, betrayals).
- Track how Fame spreads through communities via trade routes, bards, or pantheon influence.

### For Players
- Fame is a tool and a target.
- Build Fame deliberately to gain influence, but be aware it also paints a target on your back.
- Consider whether your champion seeks Fame or tries to avoid it — both are valid paths.
