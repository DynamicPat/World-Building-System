# Champion Seeds

Champion Seeds represent the **potential for greatness** within individuals across the world.  
They are not yet champions — only the *possibility* of one — born from moments of courage, loss, destiny, or divine spark. 

Note that greatness, in this context, represents **magnitude of impact** and not a "good" morality. Great can be good, bad, or anywhere in the middle.

Seeds can emerge in anyone, but only grow into true champions through **deeds, trials, and choices** that shape both the individual and the world around them.

## Nature of a Champion Seed

A Champion Seed is:
- **Latent Power** — an internal or external force that marks an individual for greatness.  
- **Narrative Catalyst** — a thread that ties personal story to the greater movements of the world.  
- **Reactive Potential** — a reflection of the world’s needs; as conflict and imbalance grow, new seeds appear.  

Champion Seeds do not guarantee triumph or virtue — they represent *potential*, not alignment or fate.

## Origins of Seeds

Champion Seeds may arise from multiple sources, depending on world tone and setting:

### 1. **Divine or Mythic Origin**
- The gods or spirits mark individuals in response to imbalance, prophecy, or devotion.  
- Example: A farmer dreams of flame and awakens able to speak to the wind.  

### 2. **Cultural or Ancestral Legacy**
- Seeds pass through bloodlines, legends, or oaths — dormant until circumstances awaken them.  
- Example: The descendant of a forgotten hero feels their ancestor’s call during a siege.  

### 3. **World Reaction**
- The world itself, as a living entity, generates champions in response to upheaval or suffering.  
- Example: A child survives a divine storm and emerges with lightning in their veins.  

### 4. **Personal Resolve**
- Some seeds are born purely of will — when a person refuses despair or fear.  
- Example: A healer who fails to save a friend becomes unshakable in purpose thereafter.

## Recognition of Seeds

Communities and cultures may **interpret seeds differently**, shaping how they are treated:
- **Divine Cultures**: Seek or worship seeded individuals as saints or omens.  
- **Rational Societies**: Deny the mystic nature and frame seeds as talent or genius.  
- **Fearful Realms**: Hunt or exile seeds as curses or signs of instability.  

These perceptions influence both the **narrative path** and the **social tension** surrounding champions.

## Developmental Phases

Champion Seeds progress through stages, often marked by in-game triggers or story events:

| Stage | Description | Common Triggers |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Dormant** | Potential unnoticed; abilities or destiny lie latent. | Birth, prophecy, bloodline, accident. |
| **Awakened** | The individual faces an event that reveals their potential. | Tragedy, miracle, battle, revelation. |
| **Tested** | The seed begins to shape reality — deeds affect community or world. | Acts of courage, moral dilemma, or loss. |
| **Forged** | Through repeated trials, the seed matures into a true Champion. | Victories, failures, or transcendent sacrifice. |
| **Ascendant** | The Champion’s impact reaches beyond self — founding clans, changing faiths, or shifting epochs. | Legendary deed, martyrdom, apotheosis. |

## Relation to World Layers

Champion Seeds exist primarily at the **Individual Layer**, but their growth reverberates upward:

| Layer | Effect of a Growing Champion |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **Individual** | Gains new abilities, resilience, and purpose. |
| **Clan** | Unity or tension may rise; clan reputation shifts with the champion’s deeds. |
| **Community** | Becomes inspired, fearful, or divided — leading to influence or unrest. |
| **Realm** | Political or military ramifications; champions may alter succession, wars, or faith. |
| **World** | Marks turning points in ages or epochs; gods and legends take notice. |

## Mechanical Hooks (Optional)

If you wish to model Seeds with mechanics:
- **Seed Tier**: 1 (Dormant) → 5 (Ascendant).  
- **Growth Trigger**: Narrative events or d20 challenge outcomes linked to personal motivation or attribute.  
- **Stat Influence**: Champions gain small permanent bonuses tied to deeds (e.g., +1 to a related attribute).  
- **Backlash**: Each stage may also create *echoes* — envy, corruption, or consequence that ripple through the world.  

---

## Recording

Each seeded individual should note:
- **Seed Origin** (Divine, Ancestral, World, or Personal).  
- **Current Stage** (Dormant → Ascendant).  
- **Trigger Event** (what first awakened potential).  
- **Associated Clan or Community Response** (support, fear, worship, etc.).  
- **Deed Record** (key moments that marked growth or loss).  

---

## Usage in Play

- Champion Seeds are **story accelerators**.  
  - They justify sudden acts of heroism, destiny, or tragedy.  
  - They turn ordinary figures into narrative keystones.  
- A world with many active seeds often signals an **age of upheaval** — an omen of change or rebirth.  
- GMs may use the appearance of new seeds as a pacing tool — a signal that **the world is ready for the next act.**
