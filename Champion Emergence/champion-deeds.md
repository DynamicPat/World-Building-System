# Champion Deeds

Champion Deeds represent the **actions that test and define a seeded individual**.  
Each deed—victory or loss—shapes the champion’s growth, their relationships, and the balance of power within the world.  

Deeds are the heartbeat of the **Champion Emergence** system: they translate story outcomes into lasting world consequences.

## Nature of Deeds

A Champion Deed is:
- **A moment of consequence**, where choice and action alter more than the self.  
- **A test of conviction**, reflecting the champion’s beliefs, attributes, and abilities.  
- **A world-reactive event**, echoing upward through clans, communities, and realms.  

Every deed carries *risk and weight*—its outcome may elevate or unravel a champion.

## Types of Deeds

| Category | Description | Typical Outcomes |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Heroic** | Acts of courage or sacrifice that inspire others. | Reputation, morale, or unity increase. |
| **Tragic** | Losses or failures that reshape resolve. | Growth through pain, new motivations. |
| **Defiant** | Rebellion against authority, fate, or gods. | Independence, chaos, or divine notice. |
| **Restorative** | Healing, peacemaking, or rebuilding efforts. | Stability and faith increase. |
| **Transformative** | Internal evolution; new purpose or moral pivot. | Alignment or path shift. |
| **Cataclysmic** | World-altering acts—slaying demigods, raising armies, shattering seals. | Regional or epochal change. |

These categories can be customized to fit setting tone and moral structure.

## Conducting a Deed

When a potential Deed occurs in play:

1. **Define Intent**  
   - What is the champion trying to achieve?  
   - What’s at stake (personally, socially, cosmically)?

2. **Identify Challenge**  
   - Determine relevant **Attributes** and **Abilities**.  
   - Roll a **d20 Challenge**:  
     - Success = Victory (growth through achievement).  
     - Failure = Loss (growth through consequence).  
     - Mixed = Complication (both progress and cost).

3. **Record Outcome**  
   - Attribute, ability, or motivation shifts.  
   - Ripple effects applied to connected world layers.  
   - Add narrative mark to the *Deed Record* in the champion’s entry.

## Growth by Victory

Victorious deeds represent mastery and destiny fulfilled.  
When a champion succeeds:

- **Immediate Growth**  
  - Gain +1 to an attribute or ability related to the deed’s nature.  
  - Add a minor Trait or Title (e.g., *Defender of Stonebrook*, *Breaker of Chains*).  

- **Narrative Ripples**  
  - **Clan**: morale or unity increases.  
  - **Community**: stability or prosperity rises.  
  - **Realm**: prestige or influence grows.  
  - **World**: may trigger prophecy, omen, or divine notice.  

- **Seed Progression**  
  - A major victory may advance the seed to the next phase (e.g., *Tested → Forged*).

## Growth by Loss

Defeat can forge champions as powerfully as triumph.  
When a champion fails meaningfully:

- **Resilience Gained**  
  - May earn a **Scar Trait** (e.g., *Cynical but Unbroken*, *Bearer of Loss*).  
  - Gain temporary advantage when facing similar future trials.  

- **Shift in Motivation**  
  - Failure alters priorities or moral compass.  
  - The champion may change alignment, clan loyalty, or purpose.  

- **Social Echoes**  
  - **Clan**: doubts rise, rivalries form.  
  - **Community**: faith shaken, unrest or empathy grows.  
  - **Realm**: shifts in political perception.  
  - **World**: loss may seed future conflict or mythic rebirth.  

> In narrative terms, a *loss* is never wasted—it sows the ground for transformation.

## Deed Scale

Deeds exist at different **scales**, influencing how far their ripples reach:

| Scale | Scope | Typical Example |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Personal** | Impacts the champion and their immediate circle. | Saving a friend, learning a truth. |
| **Clan** | Alters the clan’s stability or reputation. | A duel that settles a blood feud. |
| **Community** | Shifts local order or faith. | Defending a village, uncovering corruption. |
| **Realm** | Changes regional politics or war. | Slaying a warlord, brokering a peace. |
| **World** | Alters ages, faiths, or nature itself. | Defying a god, sealing a rift, birthing a legend. |

Each deed’s **scale** determines how deeply it is recorded in world history.

## Recording Deeds

Each champion’s record should include:
- **Deed Name** (and scale).  
- **Deed Type** (Heroic, Tragic, etc.).  
- **Outcome** (Victory, Loss, or Complication).  
- **Attributes/Abilities Tested**.  
- **Resulting Changes** (stat, motivation, or seed stage).  
- **Ripple Effects** (clan, community, realm, or world).  
- **Date or Age Marker** (for timeline tracking).

---

## Narrative Integration

- Deeds are **anchors for story structure**—they create rising action, climax, and resolution arcs.  
- The **balance** of victories and losses defines a champion’s *mythic shape*:  
  - Consistent victories → *Paragon Arc* (order, legacy, hope).  
  - Frequent losses → *Tragic Arc* (resilience, defiance, fallibility).  
  - Mixture → *Transformative Arc* (adaptation, growth, redemption).  
- Deeds can also **inspire new Seeds**, creating generational continuity and world evolution.

---

## GM/AI Use

For simulated or AI-assisted play:
- Deeds act as **data points** for world movement logic.  
- Their scale and outcome modify **influence scores** in higher layers.  
- Deeds can trigger **hooks**—new stories, conflicts, or opportunities tied to their consequences.

## Summary

Champion Deeds are the **engine of growth and change** within the world.  
They measure not only success, but the *cost of meaning*—every act of courage, defiance, or loss becomes a thread in the world’s evolving story.  

> “A champion is not the sum of their triumphs, but of the deeds that made them remember who they are.”
