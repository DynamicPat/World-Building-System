# Champion Fate

**Fate** represents the **weight of destiny** pressing upon a champion — the growing certainty that their story must reach a climax, whether in triumph or ruin. As champions gain influence and recognition, Fate accumulates, marking them as figures bound to momentous outcomes.

## Nature of Fate

Fate is:
- **A double-edged force**: It grants power and significance, but also draws danger and consequence.
- **Inevitable momentum**: The higher a champion's Fate, the more their actions matter to the world — and the more the world pushes back.
- **A countdown to resolution**: High Fate signals that a champion's arc is approaching its climax, whether through ascension, fall, or transformation.

> "To be touched by Fate is to be woven into the world's story. The question is not *if* your tale will end, but *how*."

## How Fate Accumulates

Fate increases through:

### Deeds of Consequence
- Every major victory or loss adds to Fate.
- **Scale matters**: Personal deeds add +1 Fate; world-shaking acts add +2 or more.
- **Recognition matters**: Public deeds increase Fate more than private ones.

### Fame and Notoriety
- As a champion's [Fame](/Champion%20Emergence/champion-fame.md) grows, so does their Fate.
- When Fame reaches certain thresholds (5, 10, 15), Fate increases by +1.

### Divine Notice
- Blessings, curses, or direct intervention by gods increase Fate by +1 to +3.
- Becoming a divine champion or enemy marks the individual with significant Fate.

### Failed Growth from Loss
- When a champion suffers a significant loss and fails their growth roll, Fate increases by +1.
- The loss scars them, but growth may come later when Fate manifests.

### Mythic Artifacts or Oaths
- Wielding legendary relics or swearing world-binding oaths can add +1 to +2 Fate.

## Fate Scale

Fate is tracked on a scale from **0 to 20+**:

| Fate Range | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **0–2** | Unbound | An ordinary individual; destiny has not yet claimed them. |
| **3–5** | Emerging | Fate stirs; the champion begins to matter beyond themselves. |
| **6–9** | Marked | The world recognizes this figure; their choices ripple outward. |
| **10–14** | Fated | A legend in motion; major events orbit their actions. |
| **15–19** | Doomed or Transcendent | The champion stands at a precipice; resolution is imminent. |
| **20+** | Apotheosis or Ruin | Fate demands climax — ascension, death, transformation, or myth. |

## Effects of Fate

### Narrative Weight
- **High Fate champions** become focal points for story arcs.
- Events, conflicts, and opportunities gravitate toward them.
- NPCs, communities, and even gods react to their presence more intensely.

### Decline Checks
Once Fate reaches **10 or higher**, the champion must make **Decline Checks** after significant events:

- **Trigger**: After a major defeat, betrayal, or personal crisis.
- **Mechanic**: Roll d20 + Willpower vs DC (10 + Fate modifier).
  - **Success**: The champion endures, channeling Fate into resilience.
  - **Failure**: Fate manifests as a **Decline Event**:
    - Loss of ability, injury, madness, betrayal, or omen of doom.
    - The champion may gain a **Fate Scar** (negative trait tied to their burden).

### Fate Manifestations
At high Fate levels, strange occurrences follow the champion:
- Prophetic dreams or visions.
- Enemies or rivals arise inexplicably.
- The gods or cosmic forces take direct interest.
- Natural phenomena (storms, eclipses) accompany their deeds.

### Fate Resolution
When Fate reaches **15+**, the champion's story arc demands resolution:
- **Ascension**: Become a legend, demigod, or cultural icon (retire from mortal play).
- **Martyrdom**: Die in a meaningful way that shapes the world.
- **Transformation**: Undergo a fundamental change (become a villain, prophet, or outcast).
- **Redemption or Fall**: Resolve a core tension in their arc, then Fate resets or they exit the story.

## Reducing Fate

Fate rarely decreases, but it can be managed:

### Fulfill a Destiny
- Completing a prophesied deed or personal arc may reduce Fate by 3–5.
- This represents the narrative tension being resolved.

### Rejection of the Call
- A champion may choose to step away from greatness, retiring to obscurity.
- This reduces Fate by 2–3 but also reduces Fame and influence.

### Divine Intervention
- A god may lift a curse or release a champion from their bond (rare, story-driven).

### Passing the Mantle
- Training a successor or founding a legacy allows Fate to transfer to another.
- Reduces the original champion's Fate by 1–2 per generation.

## Fate in Play

### For GMs
- Use Fate to signal when a champion's story is reaching climax.
- High-Fate champions should face increasingly personal and meaningful challenges.
- Fate creates dramatic tension: players know their legend grows, but so does the risk.

### For Players
- Fate is both reward and warning.
- Embrace it to become legendary, but know that legends often end tragically.
- Champions with high Fate are ideal for epic conclusions or retirement into myth.

- **Current Fate**: [Number]
- **Fate Status**: [Unbound / Emerging / Marked / Fated / Doomed or Transcendent]
- **Last Decline Check**: [Date, outcome]
- **Fate Scars**: [List any traits gained from failed Decline Checks]
- **Fate Events**: [Key moments that increased Fate significantly]

## Summary

Fate is the price of significance. It marks a champion as someone whose deeds will shape history, but it also binds them to a story that must eventually reach its end. The higher the Fate, the more the world demands resolution — through glory, tragedy, or transformation.

> "Fate is not a curse, nor a blessing. It is simply the world's way of saying: *Your story matters. Now see it through.*"
