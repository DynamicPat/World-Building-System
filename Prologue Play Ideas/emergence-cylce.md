# Game Start: The Emergence Cycle

This file describes how to begin play and establish the initial world state.

---

## Purpose
The **Emergence Cycle** acts as the prologue to the world. It creates a shared origin myth, establishes cultural traits, and seeds the first story tokens that evolve into player-facing hooks. The results form the **Genesis Chronicle**, which becomes the baseline for all later world turns.

## The Emergence Cycle

The foundational myth through which the first mortals reached the open world:

1. **Realm 1: Rooted Dark**  
   - Theme: scarcity and survival.  
   - Challenges: hunger, fear, predators, mistrust.  
   - Outcomes: traits of pragmatism, resilience, or division.  

2. **Realm 2: Shifting Waters**  
   - Theme: chaos and temptation.  
   - Challenges: currents, storms, siren voices, hidden bargains.  
   - Outcomes: traits of adaptability, cunning, or corruption.  

3. **Realm 3: Glimmering Sky Below**  
   - Theme: illusions and false lights.  
   - Challenges: tricksters, false gods, phantom kingdoms.  
   - Outcomes: traits of skepticism, faith, or fractured belief.  

4. **Realm 4: Open World**  
   - Theme: emergence into sun and wind under the gaze of the gods.  
   - Challenges: claiming land, meeting divine patrons, forming the first communities.  
   - Outcomes: starting pantheon influences, proto-champions, cultural memory.

## Mechanics
- Each realm is resolved with **d20 challenges**.  
- Results establish:
  - **Cultural Traits** — e.g., Valor vs. Caution.  
  - **Pantheon Influences** — which gods gained early reverence.  
  - **Founding Myths** — stories passed into the first age.  
  - **Proto-Champions** — individuals remembered for shaping survival.  

---

## Prologue Play
- Can be played **solo** (GM resolves rolls and records results) or **collaboratively** (group storytelling exercise).  
- Each challenge produces **Story Tokens**.  
- At the end of the cycle, tokens are immediately converted into **Story Hooks**, seeding the first arcs of play.  

---

## Output
- A single **Genesis Chronicle** markdown file containing:
  - The path through the realms.  
  - Cultural trait outcomes.  
  - Initial pantheon influences.  
  - List of proto-champions.  
  - Story Tokens → Hooks.  
- This file serves as the **initial world state** referenced in later turns.
