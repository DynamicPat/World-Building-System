# Stat Modifiers

This file defines the **conversion system** for translating stat values into roll modifiers across all world layers.  

All layer stats use a **1-10 scale** that converts to **d20 roll modifiers** using a consistent formula. This ensures mechanical consistency whether you're rolling for a clan's Cohesion, a community's Prosperity, or a realm's Power.

## Stat to Modifier Conversion

| Stat Value | Modifier | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **1-2** | **-2** | Severely impaired — collapse, dysfunction, or critical weakness. |
| **3-4** | **-1** | Below average — struggling, vulnerable, or unreliable. |
| **5-6** | **+0** | Average/Baseline — functional but not exceptional. |
| **7-8** | **+2** | Strong/Above average — effective, reliable, respected. |
| **9-10** | **+3** | Exceptional/Elite — mastery, dominance, or legendary status. |

## How to Use

When a layer (Clan, Community, or Realm) makes a challenge roll:

1. **Identify the relevant stat** (e.g., Cohesion for clan unity tests, Prosperity for economic challenges).
2. **Convert stat to modifier** using the table above.
3. **Roll d20 + modifier** vs Difficulty Class (DC).
4. **Interpret result**:
   - Meet or exceed DC → Success
   - Below DC → Failure
   - Natural 1 or 20 may trigger critical outcomes (GM discretion)

## Examples by Layer

### Clan Example
**Situation**: The Emberforge Smiths (Cohesion 7) must decide whether to stay united after their leader dies.

- **Stat**: Cohesion 7
- **Modifier**: +2
- **Roll**: d20 +2 vs DC 12
- **Outcome**: 
  - Success → Clan remains united, chooses new leader smoothly.
  - Failure → Clan fractures into factions, Cohesion drops to 5.

---

### Community Example
**Situation**: Stonebrook (Prosperity 4) attempts to recover from a poor harvest.

- **Stat**: Prosperity 4
- **Modifier**: -1
- **Roll**: d20 -1 vs DC 14
- **Outcome**:
  - Success → Community scrapes by, Prosperity stabilizes at 5.
  - Failure → Famine spreads, Prosperity drops to 3, generate Tragedy token.

---

### Realm Example
**Situation**: The Sunspire Dominion (Power 9) launches an invasion against a neighboring kingdom.

- **Stat**: Power 9
- **Modifier**: +3
- **Roll**: d20 +3 vs DC 15
- **Outcome**:
  - Success → Swift victory, gain territory, Power rises to 10.
  - Failure → Stalemate or retreat, Unity drops by -1 due to war exhaustion.

## Applying to Individual Attributes

While this system is designed for **collective layer stats** (Clans, Communities, Realms), individual **attributes** (Strength, Agility, Intellect, Willpower, Charisma) may use a similar conversion if you wish to standardize:

### Option 1: Direct Attribute Rolls
- Use the same 1-10 scale and modifier table.
- Example: A character with Strength 8 rolls d20 +2 for feats of might.

### Option 2: System-Agnostic Flexibility
- Leave individual attributes open to interpretation by the TTRPG system in use.
- Example: D&D 5e might use its own ability score modifiers, while this system handles the world simulation.

**Recommendation**: Use Option 2 to maintain system agnosticism at the individual layer, while enforcing consistency at collective layers.

## Adjusting Stats During Play

When events cause stats to increase or decrease:

- **+1 or -1 to a stat** may shift the modifier (e.g., Cohesion 6 → 7 changes modifier from +0 to +2).
- **Threshold crossing** is significant — moving from 6 to 7 represents a meaningful leap in capability.
- **GM discretion** on when stats change based on narrative weight and mechanical balance.

## Setting Difficulty Classes (DCs)

Use the following guidelines for DCs:

| DC | Difficulty | When to Use |
|----|------------|-------------|
| **8** | Trivial | Routine tasks with minimal challenge. |
| **10** | Easy | Straightforward challenges with some risk. |
| **12** | Moderate | Standard difficulty; fair chance of success or failure. |
| **15** | Hard | Significant challenge requiring strength or luck. |
| **18** | Very Hard | Exceptional effort required; likely failure without high stats. |
| **20+** | Near Impossible | Reserved for legendary acts or desperate measures. |

**Note**: The system default for strained community needs is **DC 12** (moderate difficulty).

---

## Summary

- **All collective stats** (1-10 scale) convert to **d20 modifiers** (-2 to +3).
- **Consistency across layers** ensures predictable mechanics.
- **Bounded modifiers** (+3 max) mean dice rolls still matter — even elite entities can fail.
- **Threshold effects** make each stat point meaningful, especially at boundaries (4→5, 6→7, 8→9).
