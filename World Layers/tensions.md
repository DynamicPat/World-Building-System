# Tensions Framework

This file defines **tensions** across collective layers of the world system.  
Tensions represent the **fractures, rivalries, and strains** that challenge stability and unity. They are the counterweight to bonds and resources, ensuring that no group or society is ever free from conflict.  

Like resources, tensions exist at multiple world layers:  
- **Clans**: Rivalries, betrayals, fractures within a tight-knit group.  
- **Communities**: Political unrest, sectarian strife, systemic injustice.  
- **Realms**: Wars, ideological divides, large-scale instability.  

---

## Primary vs. Secondary Tensions

- **Primary Tensions**: Inherent vulnerabilities tied to bonds or structures (e.g., clans fractured by bloodline succession disputes, communities torn by sectarian divides).  
- **Secondary Tensions**: Circumstantial or environmental pressures layered on top (e.g., famine, debt, external invasion).  

This dual system ensures tensions are both **predictable** (systemic) and **varied** (narrative).

## Layer by Layer

### Clans
- **Nature of Tensions**: Inverse of **bond type** plus added pressures.  
- **Primary Tensions**:  
  - Bloodline → Succession disputes, generational divides.  
  - Oath → Broken promises, schisms over doctrine.  
  - Contract → Greed, betrayal, collapse when resources fail.  
  - Ideology → Purges of dissent, extremism.  
  - Survival → Desperation, distrust once danger fades.  
  - Opportunity → Rivalry for spoils, envy of success.  
  - Rivalry → Obsession with enemy, collapse if foe disappears.  
  - Patronage → Succession crises, collapse if leader falters.  
- **Secondary Tensions**: Scarcity of food, external enemies, curses, rival clan hostility.

### Communities
- **Nature of Tensions**: Systemic strains across needs and governance.  
- **Primary Tensions**:  
  - Needs falling into **Strained/Failing** (famine unrest, trade collapse, lawlessness).  
  - Factional disputes between clans, guilds, or faiths.  
- **Secondary Tensions**:  
  - Corruption in leadership.  
  - Class or cultural divides.  
  - Sectarian or ethnic conflict.  
  - Natural disasters or external threats.

### Realms
- **Nature of Tensions**: Large-scale instability across politics, ideology, and war.  
- **Primary Tensions**:  
  - Border wars with neighbors.  
  - Noble or clan rebellions.  
  - Collapsing trade networks.  
  - Rival ideologies threatening unity.  
- **Secondary Tensions**:  
  - Proxy wars fueled by other nations.  
  - Succession crises at the highest levels.  
  - Divine schisms or pantheon disputes.  
  - Economic collapse rippling across borders.

## Usage
- **At creation**: Assign each entity 1 **primary tension** and optionally 1 **secondary tension**.  
- **In play**: Tensions evolve after major events (victories/losses).  
- **Challenges**: Tensions can be invoked as **story hooks** or modifiers for rolls.  
  - Example: A community with *Tension: Failing Food Supply* → all Prosperity-based rolls are at disadvantage until resolved.  
- **Escalation**: If left unresolved, tensions **spread upward or downward** through layers.  
  - Clan feud → destabilizes a community council.  
  - Regional war → fractures communities and clans beneath it.

## Recording
Each entity entry (clan, community, region) should include:  
- **Primary Tension** (systemic, predictable).  
- **Secondary Tension** (circumstantial, unique).  
- Notes on escalation or resolution.
