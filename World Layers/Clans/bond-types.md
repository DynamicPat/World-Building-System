# Bond Types

This file defines the **bond types** that hold clans together. A bond type is the **core glue** of the group — the reason its members act as one. Clans may shift bond types over time, especially after victories, losses, or cultural change.

## Usage
- When creating a clan, assign one **primary bond type**.  
- Clans may evolve or **shift bond types** over time (e.g., a survival band becoming an oathbound order, or an ideological cult splintering into rivalries).  
- Bond type influences **Cohesion**, **Capability**, and **Reputation**, and serves as a narrative shorthand for roleplaying.
- Bond types have bi-directional influence on individuals and groups. Individuals in a group with a specific bond type will most likely act in accordance with that bond. Acting against the type of bond by one to many individuals in a group will trigger conflict/rifts (be they social or physical).
