# World Layer: Clans

This file defines the **Clan Layer** of the world system. Clans are small groups of individuals who share bonds through kinship, work, ideology, or necessity. They sit between individuals and communities, acting as the **building blocks of social life**.

---

## Role in the System
- Clans provide the **first layer of collective identity** above individuals.  
- They may be **families, guild cells, mercenary companies, pilgrim groups, conspiracies, or any other meaningful collection of individuals**.  
- Their cohesion and choices ripple upward to shape communities and regions.  
- They serve as natural story seeds for adventuring parties, rival families, or religious sects.

## Structure of a Clan

### Core Traits
- **Size**: Typically 2–12 individuals. 2 is the minimum possible floor, but it's possible to have a clan larger than 12 when necessary. 
- **Bond Type**: What holds them together (See [Bond Types](bond-types.md) for more information).  
- **Resources**: Assets they share (See the clan section in [Resources](/World%20Layers/resources.md) for more information).  
- **Tension**: Internal strains (See the clan section in [Tensions](/World%20Layers/tensions.md) for more information).  

### Stat Block
#### Cohesion
- **Definition**: Loyalty, unity, and willingness of members to act together.  
- **Scale** (1–10):  
  - **1–2**: Clan is fracturing; betrayal and desertion likely.  
  - **3–4**: Weak unity; disagreements common, fragile cooperation.  
  - **5–6**: Stable; loyalty holds but tested under stress.  
  - **7–8**: Strong unity; members act as one, trust is deep.  
  - **9–10**: Near-unbreakable loyalty; members would sacrifice everything for each other.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after victories that strengthen bonds (defending kin, completing a quest together).  
  - -1 after losses, betrayal, or unresolved tensions.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: High cohesion reduces internal conflict. Low cohesion risks **splits** or **factionalization**.

#### Capability
- **Definition**: The clan’s collective ability to succeed in its main activity (warfare, trade, craft, survival, etc).  
- **Scale** (1–10):  
  - **1–2**: Ineffective; disorganized, poorly equipped, or incompetent.  
  - **3–4**: Basic skill; can handle simple tasks, struggles with serious challenges.  
  - **5–6**: Competent; reliable in their domain, respected locally.  
  - **7–8**: Highly skilled; effective even against strong opposition.  
  - **9–10**: Renowned mastery; clan defines excellence in their field.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after victories tied to expertise (winning a battle, creating a masterpiece, thriving in trade).  
  - -1 after defeats, resource loss, or botched endeavors.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Used as a modifier in challenges where the clan acts as a whole (e.g., “Can this clan hold the pass against raiders?”).  

---

#### Reputation
- **Definition**: How outsiders perceive the clan — fame, notoriety, trustworthiness, or fear.  
- **Scale** (1–10):  
  - **1–2**: Infamous, distrusted, or mocked.  
  - **3–4**: Unknown or poorly regarded.  
  - **5–6**: Locally known and modestly respected.  
  - **7–8**: Regionally renowned or feared.  
  - **9–10**: Legendary; songs, stories, or myths spread their name.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after public victories, notable deeds, or alliances.  
  - -1 after scandals, humiliations, or defeats known to outsiders.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Reputation modifies how other clans, communities, and champions respond to them.  

---

#### Rolling Challenges
When a clan acts as a unit:  
- Roll **d20 + relevant stat** vs Difficulty Class (DC).  
- Example: *Clan Reputation 7* (modifier +2) rolls to negotiate trade → d20 +2 vs DC.  

---

#### Example Clan Stat Block

**Clan: The Emberforge Smiths**  
- **Bond Type**: Craft (blacksmithing guild family).  
- **Primary Tension**: Generational conflict (elders vs apprentices).  
- **Secondary Tension**: Scarcity of ore.  
- **Cohesion**: 6 (stable but tested).  
- **Capability**: 8 (renowned blacksmiths).  
- **Reputation**: 7 (respected in region).  
- **Resources**: Fine forge, ore stockpiles (failing), trade contacts.  
- **Notable Champion**: Arvend the Hammerwright.  

---

#### Summary of Use
- **Cohesion** = loyalty and stability.  
- **Capability** = effectiveness in their focus.  
- **Reputation** = social standing and external perception.  
- All are rated **1–10**, adjusted after victories, losses, or story events.   

---

## Growth and Change
- **Victories**: Clans that succeed (e.g., defeating raiders, pulling off a trade venture) gain Cohesion, Reputation, or Capability.  
- **Losses**: Defeats may split clans, but can also forge tighter unity or radicalize them.  
- **Champion Influence**: A single champion within a clan can redefine its role and destiny.  
- **Clan Legacy**: Over time, successful clans evolve into guilds, noble houses, or founding lineages of larger communities.  

---

## Interaction with Higher Layers
- **Communities**: Clans form the **core social units** of a town or tribe. Their rivalries or alliances determine local stability.  
- **Realms**: Influential clans may grow into noble houses, guilds, or warbands.  
- **World**: Legendary clans (explorers, cultists, conquerors) become myths that shape culture and pantheon stories.  

---

## Narrative Use
- Clans create **tangible social hooks**: rival families, traveling caravans, secret societies.  
- They allow GMs to inject interpersonal drama at a level bigger than one individual but smaller than a whole community.  
- A clan can be elevated to a **primary faction** if it grows in influence through deeds or player engagement.

## Output for Recording
- Each clan receives a **markdown entry**:  
  - Name, Bond Type, Core Members.  
  - Stat Block (Cohesion, Capability, Reputation).  
  - Resources & Tensions.  
  - Notable Champions.  
  - Relationship with communities.
