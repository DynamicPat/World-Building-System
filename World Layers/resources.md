# Resources Framework

This file defines how **resources** function across all layers of the world system — from individuals up through clans, communities, and realms. Resources represent the tangible and intangible assets that provide strength, security, or influence.  

---

## Shared Resource Categories

All layers draw from the same **core categories**, but at different scales:

### Material
- **Land** — farmland, mines, strongholds.  
- **Wealth** — coin, gems, trade goods.  
- **Arms & Armor** — weapons, protective gear.  
- **Craft Tools** — artisan or alchemical equipment.  
- **Provisions** — food, water, and reserves.  

### Social
- **Allies** — people or groups who can be called upon.  
- **Contacts** — networks of informants, traders, or spies.  
- **Reputation** — recognition and standing with others.  
- **Patronage** — support from a leader, champion, or deity.  
- **Secrets** — hidden leverage or forbidden knowledge.  

### Cultural
- **Lore** — collected histories, traditions, arcane texts.  
- **Faith** — spiritual influence or divine blessing.  
- **Artistry** — crafts, music, or cultural works.  
- **Customs** — practices and rituals that bind members.  

### Magical/Exceptional
- **Relics** — sacred or arcane artifacts.  
- **Mystics** — shamans, seers, or sorcerers.  
- **Blessings** — divine favor or oaths.  
- **Curses** — dark powers granting strength at a cost.

## Scaling by World Layer

### Individuals
- **Personal Resources**: weapons, tools, mentors, heirlooms, favors owed.  
- **Impact**: Primarily influence **their own deeds**.  
- **Traits**: Unique, defining, often narrative hooks.  
- **Example**: A farmer’s plow, a rogue’s blackmail letter, a priest’s relic.  

### Clans
- **Shared Resources**: pooled assets like caravans, storehouses, or sacred shrines.  
- **Impact**: Directly tied to **Cohesion, Capability, and Reputation**.  
- **Traits**: Defined by **Quality, Security, and Scale**.  
- **Example**: A clan’s trade caravan (Material), their ancestral blessing (Faith), or a network of spies (Contacts).  

### Communities
- **Collective Resources**: fields, markets, armories, guilds, temples.  
- **Impact**: Represent **Prosperity, Stability, and Influence**.  
- **Traits**: Tracked in **abundance levels** (Abundant, Stable, Limited, Strained, Failing).  
- **Example**: A thriving market square, a communal granary, a temple with realm renown.  

### Realms
- **Macro Resources**: armies, trade networks, religious authority, mythic artifacts.  
- **Impact**: Drive diplomacy, wars, cultural spread, and pantheon disputes.  
- **Traits**: Recorded as **Strategic Assets** that affect multiple communities.  
- **Example**: A kingdom’s navy, a mountain fortress, a legendary relic claimed as a national symbol.

## Resource Traits

Each resource at clan level and above is tracked with three traits:  
- **Quality**: Poor, Adequate, Fine, Legendary.  
- **Security**: Stable, Vulnerable, Contested.  
- **Scale**: Small (local), Moderate (regional), Large (far-reaching).  

For individuals, resources are tracked narratively with fewer traits, focusing on uniqueness and story relevance.  

---

## Growth and Loss
- **Victories**: Expand or upgrade resources (gain new allies, seize land, secure relics).  
- **Losses**: Drain or destroy resources (famine ruins provisions, a patron withdraws support).  
- **Tokens → Hooks**: Resource changes often generate Story Tokens (Triumph, Tragedy, Betrayal, Discovery), which convert into Story Hooks.  

---

## Usage in Play
- **Individuals**: Resources define character flavor and personal leverage.  
- **Clans**: Resources stabilize the group and can be strained or stolen.  
- **Communities**: Resources represent societal health and drive arcs.  
- **Realms**: Resources become the stakes of diplomacy, war, and myth.  

---

## Recording
- **Individuals**: List resources directly on the character’s markdown sheet.  
- **Clans**: Record in a dedicated section with quality/security/scale.  
- **Communities**: Track abundance levels of each critical need.  
- **Realms**: Maintain a ledger of strategic assets and their influence range.
