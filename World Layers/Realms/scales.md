# Realm Scales

This file defines the different **scales of realms** within the world system.  
Scale determines a realm’s **geographic size, population, complexity, and sphere of influence**. It provides a framework for distinguishing a small city-state from a sprawling empire, and it sets expectations for Power, Unity, and Prestige.  

Each scale also includes a **rough range of communities and clans** typically found within it.

## Types of Realm Scale

### City-State
- **Population**: 25,000–100,000  
- **Territory**: A city and its immediate hinterlands.  
- **Communities**: 1 major city, 2–6 surrounding villages/towns.  
- **Clans**: 30–80 (dense within the city and surrounding lands).  
- **Traits**:  
  - Power concentrated in a single urban hub.  
  - Prosperity and survival often tied to trade routes.  
  - Culturally influential despite modest territorial size.  
- **Examples**: Independent ports, temple-cities, mage-run polities.
