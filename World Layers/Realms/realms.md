# World Layer: Realms

This file defines the **Realm Layer** of the world system.  
Realms represent the **largest organized units of power** in the world — nations, empires, federations, or vast cultural territories. They are composed of many communities and clans, and they often shape the fate of the entire world.  

---

## Role in the System
- Realms embody **political authority, cultural identity, and military power**.  
- They are the key drivers of **wars, alliances, trade networks, and religious schisms**.  
- Their rise and fall define eras of history.  
- For players, realms provide the **macro stage** for stories, influencing the world even when adventures remain local.

  - **7–8**: Respected — admired, feared, or courted internationally.  
  - **9–10**: Legendary — world-shaping reputation, cultural or divine beacon.

---

### Rolling Challenges
When a realm takes major actions, roll:

- Example: *Realm Power 8* (modifier +3) rolls to conquer a neighbor → d20 +3 vs DC.

### Summary of Use
- **Power** = military force and capacity for war.

- **Prestige** = cultural, diplomatic, or religious renown on the world stage.  
- All are rated **1–10**, adjusted after historic victories, crises, or betrayals.

---

## Interaction with Other Layers

- **Clans**: Often the noble houses, guilds, or warbands that compose the realm’s structure.  
- **World**: Realms are the key actors in shaping **global history, myth, and divine politics**.  

---

## Narrative Use

- They frame the **backdrop for adventuring parties**, whether as servants of the crown, rebels, or wanderers caught in history.  
- They evolve dynamically, giving a sense of historical momentum even when players act locally.
