# World Layer: Realms

This file defines the **Realm Layer** of the world system.  
Realms represent the **largest organized units of power** in the world — nations, empires, federations, or vast cultural territories. They are composed of many communities and clans, and they often shape the fate of the entire world.  

---

## Role in the System
- Realms embody **political authority, cultural identity, and military power**.  
- They are the key drivers of **wars, alliances, trade networks, and religious schisms**.  
- Their rise and fall define eras of history.  
- For players, realms provide the **macro stage** for stories, influencing the world even when adventures remain local.

### Core Traits
- **Scale**: Spans many communities, from small kingdoms to sprawling empires. See [scales](scales.md) for more information.

### Stat Block
# Realm Stat Blocks

This file defines the **mechanical structure** of realm stat blocks.  
Realms are measured with three core stats: **Power, Unity, and Prestige**. These stats capture a realm’s ability to wage war, maintain internal stability, and influence the wider world.  

---

## Core Stats

### Power
- **Definition**: The realm’s military strength, strategic resources, and capacity for expansion or defense.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Shattered — fragmented forces, realm unable to defend itself.  
  - **3–4**: Weak — small standing forces, vulnerable to stronger neighbors.  
  - **5–6**: Reliable — solid defenses, regional wars possible.  
  - **7–8**: Dominant — disciplined armies, advanced military systems, regional supremacy.  
  - **9–10**: Supreme — unmatched global military, feared across the world.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after conquests, major victories, or acquiring new strategic resources.  
  - -1 after defeats, rebellions, or collapse of supply lines.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Determines outcomes of wars, raids, and military diplomacy.  

---

### Unity
- **Definition**: The cohesion of the realm’s clans, communities, and factions.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Civil War — realm fractured, collapse imminent.  
  - **3–4**: Fragile — persistent unrest, nobles or clans defy central rule.  
  - **5–6**: Balanced — disagreements exist, but the realm holds together.  
  - **7–8**: Strong — loyalty widespread, disputes quickly resolved.  
  - **9–10**: Absolute — nearly unshakable unity, realm moves as one.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after resolving succession, integrating new clans, or inspiring victories.  
  - -1 after rebellions, corruption, famine, or foreign interference.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Determines resilience against tensions, risk of rebellion, and ability to recover after crises.  

---

### Prestige
- **Definition**: The realm’s reputation, legitimacy, and influence across the world stage.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Reviled — realm mocked, distrusted, or forgotten.  
  - **3–4**: Marginal — recognized only by nearby neighbors.  
  - **5–6**: Regional — seen as a legitimate local power.  
  - **7–8**: Respected — admired, feared, or courted internationally.  
  - **9–10**: Legendary — world-shaping reputation, cultural or divine beacon.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after diplomatic triumphs, cultural milestones, or producing champions.  
  - -1 after humiliations, great defeats, or divine condemnation.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Determines diplomatic leverage, spread of culture, and ability to attract allies.  

---

### Rolling Challenges
When a realm takes major actions, roll:  
- **d20 + stat modifier** vs Difficulty Class (DC).  
- **Stat to Modifier Conversion**: See [Stat Modifiers](/Core%20Mechanics/stat-modifiers.md) for the full conversion table.
  - Stats 1-2 = -2 modifier
  - Stats 3-4 = -1 modifier  
  - Stats 5-6 = +0 modifier
  - Stats 7-8 = +2 modifier
  - Stats 9-10 = +3 modifier
- **Example**: *Realm Power 8* (modifier +2) rolls to conquer a neighbor → d20 +2 vs DC 15.

### Summary of Use
- **Power** = military force and capacity for war.  
- **Unity** = internal stability and loyalty of clans/communities.  
- **Prestige** = cultural, diplomatic, or religious renown on the world stage.  
- All are rated **1–10**, adjusted after historic victories, crises, or betrayals.  
- Realms evolve dynamically: **growth or collapse ripples down** to affect communities and clans, creating story hooks across the world.   

---

## Growth and Change
- **Victories**: Conquest, diplomacy, cultural achievements, or discoveries.  
- **Losses**: Military defeat, famine, rebellions, or divine curses.  
- **Champion Influence**: Rulers, heroes, or villains can alter the destiny of a realm.  
- **Realm Legacy**: Realms leave behind cultural, political, or religious imprints that shape the world long after their fall.  

---

## Interaction with Other Layers
- **Communities**: The lifeblood of realms; their prosperity or unrest builds into larger trends.  
- **Clans**: Often the noble houses, guilds, or warbands that compose the realm’s structure.  
- **World**: Realms are the key actors in shaping **global history, myth, and divine politics**.  

---

## Narrative Use
- Realms provide **epic-scale hooks**: wars, alliances, revolutions, and divine mandates.  
- They frame the **backdrop for adventuring parties**, whether as servants of the crown, rebels, or wanderers caught in history.  
- They evolve dynamically, giving a sense of historical momentum even when players act locally.
