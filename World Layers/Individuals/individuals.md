# World Layer: Individuals

This file defines the **Individual Layer** of the world system. Individuals are the smallest unit of the simulation and the foundation upon which larger groups, communities, and nations are built.

---

## Role in the System
- Individuals provide **character-driven detail** to the world.  
- They can be **background NPCs**, **supporting characters**, or **major champions**.  
- Their actions, victories, and losses ripple upward into clans, communities, and beyond.  
- They are the primary **actors of change**, whether through deliberate deeds or incidental influence.

## Structure of an Individual

### Stat Block
Each individual has a simplified stat block:
- **Attributes**: Strength, Agility, Intellect, Willpower, Charisma (See [Attributes](attributes.md) for more information).  
- **Abilities**: Areas of competence (See [Abilities](abilities.md) for more information).  
- **Motivations**: What drives them (See [Motivations](motivations.md) for more information).  
- **Resources**: Material or social advantages (See the individuals section in [Resources](/World%20Layers/resources.md) for more information). 

### Archetypes
Archetypes provide quick shorthand for creating individuals. See [Archetypes](archetypes.md) for more information.

## Growth and Change

### Champion Emergence
- Individuals may become **champions** through notable deeds.  
- Champion Seeds can appear after victories or losses.  
- Champions progress along **Champion Paths** (see [Champion Paths](champion-paths.md) for more information).  

### Victories
- Successes can yield:  
  - **Stat improvements**.  
  - **New talents**.  
  - **Path advancement**.  
  - **Story Tokens**, which can seed new arcs.  

### Losses
- Defeats can also foster growth:  
  - Gain traits like Resilience, Ruthlessness, or Cunning.  
  - Trigger Path Shifts (e.g., Outcast → Survivor, Warrior → Mystic).  
  - Produce **darker hooks** for future stories.  

---

## Interaction with Higher Layers
- **Clans**: Families inherit traits from prominent individuals.  
- **Communities**: Champions provide bonuses to stability, prosperity, or influence.  
- **Realms**: Notable individuals become leaders, generals, or cultural icons.  
- **World**: Legends, myths, and religious figures emerge from individual deeds.  

---

## Narrative Use
- Individuals act as **lenses for story arcs**.  
- Even background NPCs can be elevated into importance through player interaction or world events.  
- GMs can create a **roster of individuals** tied to each community, with archetypes and quick stats.

## Output for Recording
- Each important individual receives a **markdown sheet**:  
  - Name, Archetype, Stat Block, Motivations, Resources, Fate.  
  - Key Deeds (victories or losses).  
  - Current Champion Path (if any).  
  - Relationships (family, rivals, allies, mentors).
