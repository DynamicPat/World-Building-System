- Champion Paths provide **narrative direction** for individuals who rise in prominence.  
- Paths are **not tied to alignment**; a Warrior can be a noble protector or a cruel bandit, depending on context.  
- Growth is triggered by both **victories** and **losses**, allowing champions to be forged from triumph or tragedy.  
- Paths may **shift** through critical moments (e.g., a Survivor becoming a Leader, a Leader falling into Tyranny).
