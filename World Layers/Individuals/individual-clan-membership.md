## General Guidelines

| Number of Clans | Frequency | Description |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| **0 (Clanless)** | Rare | True hermits, exiles, or outsiders. Most societies distrust or pity the clanless. Their independence can be a source of strength or danger. |
| **1–4 (Common Range)** | Common | Typical individuals maintain ties to one or more clans through birth, marriage, patronage, or profession. These relationships form the foundation of social identity. |
| **5+ (Multiple Allegiances)** | Rare | Reserved for exceptional individuals — diplomats, champions, or those with unusual destinies. Such people must balance competing loyalties carefully. |
