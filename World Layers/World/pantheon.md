# Pantheon

This file defines the **pantheon** of gods that shape faith, culture, and divine influence across the world system. The pantheon is organized into three tiers, inspired by Greek, Roman, and Celtic traditions, with each deity embodying fundamental concepts and forces.

---

## Structure of the Pantheon

The pantheon consists of three tiers:
1. **High Triad**: The primal forces that underpin existence.
2. **Middle Court**: The gods of mortal concerns and civilized life.
3. **Wild Powers**: The untamed, chaotic, or shadowed aspects of reality.

Each tier serves different narrative and mechanical purposes, from world-shaping forces to personal patron deities.
