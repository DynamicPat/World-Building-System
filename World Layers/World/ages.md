# Ages

This file defines the **structure of ages** in the world system.  
Ages represent **distinct historical periods within an epoch**, each characterized by specific themes, powers, and cultural shifts. While epochs span centuries or millennia, ages provide more granular divisions that mark meaningful transitions in world history.

---

## What an Age Represents

- A **subdivision of an epoch**, typically lasting decades to a few centuries.
- A period defined by a **dominant theme, conflict, or cultural movement**.
- Ages transition when **significant but not world-shattering events** occur.
- Multiple ages exist within a single epoch, each building upon or reacting to the previous.

---

## Relationship to Epochs

- **Epochs** define the fundamental order of the world (e.g., "Age of Divine Oversight").
- **Ages** define the chapters within that order (e.g., "Age of First Temples," "Age of Schism," "Age of Divine Retreat").
- When an **epoch** ends, a new epoch begins with its own first age.
- See [Epochs](epochs.md) for more information on the broader framework.
