# Epochs

This file defines the **structure of epochs** in the world system.  
Epochs represent the **broadest eras of history**, each encompassing multiple ages. They provide the framework for understanding world-scale shifts without predefining specific histories.  

---

## What an Epoch Represents
- A **grand division of time**, often lasting centuries or millennia.  
- A period where the **fundamental order of the world** remains consistent.  
- Ends only after a **catalyst event** so powerful it reshapes the very foundations of existence.

## Core Elements of an Epoch

### Theme
- A unifying concept that defines the epoch’s character.  
- Examples: Divine Oversight, Rise of Mortals, Endless War, Age of Exploration, Cosmic Silence.  

### Duration
- Long enough to include several ages.  
- The actual length is **flexible**, set by story and narrative needs, not fixed years.  

### Forces in Power
- Who or what dominates the epoch?  
- Pantheons, empires, natural phenomena, or even absent forces (e.g., no gods).  

### Defining Traits
- The characteristics that shape life during the epoch.  
- Political order, cultural focus, magical trends, divine presence/absence.  

### Catalyst (Transition Trigger)
- The event that ends an epoch and gives rise to the next.  
- Examples: Collapse of a pantheon, shattering of an empire, global cataclysm, new creation myth, mortal ascension.

## Relationship to Ages
- **Ages** exist within epochs, providing smaller-scale historical shifts.  
- Example: An epoch may represent “Divine Oversight,” while its ages show different phases of divine rule (unity, schism, retreat).

## Recording
When recording an epoch, include:  
- **Name** (chosen by players, cultures, or chroniclers).  
- **Theme** (broad idea shaping the era).  
- **Forces in Power** (who/what dominates).  
- **Defining Traits** (social, political, cultural, magical).  
- **Catalyst** (what might end it).  
- **Contained Ages** (subdivisions with their own traits).

## Usage
- Epochs provide the **largest narrative arcs** in the world.  
- They give campaigns a sense of history and myth that outlasts individuals, clans, and even realms.  
- They allow for **multi-campaign continuity**, where future stories build upon the legacies of prior epochs.
