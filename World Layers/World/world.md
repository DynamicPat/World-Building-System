# World Layer: The World

This file defines the **World Layer** of the system.  
The World represents the **sum of all realms, communities, clans, and individuals** — the highest level of abstraction. It is the stage on which history, myth, and cosmic forces unfold.  

Unlike lower layers, the World is not a single entity but a **living system** composed of all its parts. It serves as the backdrop for storytelling and a framework for tracking the **broadest arcs of change**.  

---

## Role in the System
- Provides the **macro context** for all other layers.  
- Tracks **epochs and ages**
- Tracks **world-defining events**.  
- Reflects how **gods, myths, and natural forces** shape mortal lives.  
- Ensures player actions can ripple outward to influence the destiny of entire civilizations.

## Core Traits of the World

### Balance of Realms
- **Definition**: The relative strength and stability of major realms.  
- **Use**: Determines whether the world is multipolar (many realms balanced), unipolar (one empire dominates), or fractured (realms in decline).  

### Global Tensions
- **Definition**: Large-scale conflicts that affect the whole world.  
- **Examples**:  
  - A great war spanning continents.  
  - A pantheon schism dividing faiths.  
  - A plague or magical curse sweeping lands.  
  - Climate shifts, famine cycles, or natural cataclysms.  

### Cultural Currents
- **Definition**: Stories, ideologies, and faiths that transcend borders.  
- **Use**: Spread of religions, philosophies, and myths; often shape the identity of entire ages.  

### Cosmic Influences
- **Definition**: Forces beyond mortal control — gods, spirits, stars, or otherworldly beings.  
- **Use**: Determine whether the world is in an **age of favor**, an **age of silence**, or an **age of chaos**.

## World Stat Block
At the highest layer, the World can be measured by three broad traits:  

- **Flux** — degree of change or upheaval in the world order.  
  - Low (1–3): World stable, slow change.  
  - Mid (4–6): Conflicts and innovations shape regions.  
  - High (7–10): Ages shift; wars, cataclysms, or divine interventions reshape history.  

- **Mythos** — strength of gods, legends, and cosmic forces in daily life.  
  - Low (1–3): Rational, mortal-driven age.  
  - Mid (4–6): Gods and myths shape cultures but remain contested.  
  - High (7–10): Divine or magical forces actively reshape reality.  

- **Connectivity** — degree to which realms and peoples are linked.  
  - Low (1–3): Isolated realms, fragmented world.  
  - Mid (4–6): Regional trade and diplomacy link neighbors.  
  - High (7–10): Global systems of trade, war, and myth bind all.

## Growth and Change
- **Ages**: The world shifts through defined ages (e.g., *Age of Dawn*, *Age of Conquest*, *Age of Silence*).  
- **Catalysts**: Major victories, apocalyptic events, or divine mandates can trigger world-level shifts.  
- **Player Impact**: Player-driven deeds (slaying gods, uniting empires, shattering artifacts) can escalate from local → realm → world scale.  

---

## Interaction with Other Layers
- **Realms**: Rise and fall determine the balance of world power.  
- **Communities**: Provide the foundation of cultural currents.  
- **Clans**: Can birth champions or rivalries that scale upward.  
- **Individuals**: At rare times, a single champion may tip the balance of an entire age.  

---

## Narrative Use
- The World provides **epic-scale arcs**:  
  - "The Dawn Age of the Gods is ending…"  
  - "The Great War spans every horizon…"  
  - "The seas are drying; famine spreads across continents…"  
- Serves as a **chronicle framework**, allowing GMs to mark where in the world’s timeline the story takes place.  
- Ensures continuity between campaigns or generations of play.

## Recording
Each World entry should include:  
- **Current Age** and its defining themes.  
- **Balance of Realms** (dominant, fractured, or multipolar).  
- **Global Tensions** (at least 1 active).  
- **Cultural Currents** (spread of ideas/faiths).  
- **Cosmic Influences** (pantheon status, divine silence, celestial cycles).  
- **World Stat Block** (Flux, Mythos, Connectivity).
