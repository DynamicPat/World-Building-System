# Needs

This file defines the **needs** that sustain a community.  
Needs represent the fundamental systems and resources required for survival, stability, and growth. A community’s ability to meet its needs determines its **Prosperity, Stability, and Influence**, and shifting needs often generate story hooks.  

Community **size** (Hamlet → Village → Town → City → Metropolis) affects both the **complexity of needs** and the **difficulty of maintaining them**. Larger communities must manage greater demand and more intricate systems.

## Core Needs

### Food
- **Definition**: The community’s access to sustenance through farming, herding, hunting, or imports.

## Optional Expanded Needs
Depending on setting, additional needs may be tracked:  
- **Knowledge** — libraries, schools, archives (town+).  
- **Infrastructure** — roads, aqueducts, housing (city+).  
- **Magic** — protective wards, arcane resources (any size but scales strongly at city+).  

---

## Usage
- Each community tracks all **core needs** at one of five **abundance levels**: Abundant, Stable, Limited, Strained, Failing.  
- **Community size** modifies both the *baseline difficulty* of maintaining needs and the *consequences* of failure.  
- Needs directly influence **community stat blocks**:  
  - **Prosperity** rises with strong Food/Trade.  
  - **Stability** rises with strong Protection/Faith/Justice.  
  - **Influence** rises when needs are abundant, drawing outsiders.  
- Shifts in needs generate **story hooks**.

## Recording
Each community entry should track needs as follows:  
- **Need**: [Abundance Level] (plus notes on how size affects it)  
- Example:  
  - Food: Limited (Village → harvest failure threatens survival).  
  - Trade: Abundant (Town → caravan hub with strong markets).  
  - Protection: Strained (City → guard spread thin, crime rising).  
  - Faith: Stable (Village → single temple still unites community).  
  - Justice: Failing (Metropolis → corruption, bribes, mob trials).
