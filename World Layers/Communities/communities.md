# World Layer: Communities

This file defines the **Community Layer** of the world system.  
Communities represent collections of clans, families, and individuals bound together into a **shared settlement or social unit**. They are larger than clans but smaller than regions, serving as the primary hubs where everyday life, politics, and trade converge.  

---

## Role in the System
- Communities embody the **heart of civilization**: villages, towns, nomadic encampments, or city districts.  
- They are the primary stage where **clan rivalries, resource struggles, and cultural exchange** play out.  
- The **health and needs** of a community ripple outward, influencing regions and shaping history.  
- They provide natural **centers for adventurers** — full of NPCs, intrigue, and shifting conditions.

## Structure of a Community

### Core Traits
- **Size**: From a few dozen (hamlet) to several thousand (city district). See [sizes](sizes.md) for more information.  
- **Composition**: Which clans and cultural groups make up the community.  
- **Resources**: Shared economic, cultural, or spiritual assets (See the communities section in [Resources](/World%20Layers/resources.md) for more information).  
- **Needs**: What the community depends on to survive (See [needs](needs.md) for more information).  
- **Tensions**: Strains between clans, leaders, or external threats. See the communities section of [tensions](/World%20Layers/tensions.md) for more information. 

### Stat Block
#### Prosperity
- **Definition**: The wealth, resources, and material well-being of the community.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Destitute — widespread poverty, famine, or collapse of trade.  
  - **3–4**: Struggling — shortages are common, survival precarious.  
  - **5–6**: Stable — basic needs met, modest growth possible.  
  - **7–8**: Thriving — surplus production, active trade, and visible prosperity.  
  - **9–10**: Flourishing — great wealth, luxury, or economic dominance.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after trade booms, harvests, or resource discoveries.  
  - -1 after famine, blockades, or resource loss.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Affects how well the community can meet **Food, Trade, and Infrastructure needs**; higher prosperity improves resilience to crises.  

---

#### Stability
- **Definition**: The unity, order, and safety of the community.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Collapse — riots, lawlessness, or total breakdown of order.  
  - **3–4**: Unstable — frequent unrest, corruption, or fear.  
  - **5–6**: Balanced — tensions exist, but life continues reliably.  
  - **7–8**: Secure — justice, protection, and social trust are strong.  
  - **9–10**: Harmonious — near-unshakable cohesion and peace.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after victories in defense, fair governance, or resolution of disputes.  
  - -1 after raids, injustice, corruption, or failure to protect citizens.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Affects community response to **Protection, Justice, and Faith needs**; low stability creates unrest, rebellion, or crime.

#### Influence
- **Definition**: The degree of recognition, power, or reach the community has beyond its borders.  
- **Scale (1–10)**:  
  - **1–2**: Insignificant — forgotten or ignored by outsiders.  
  - **3–4**: Local — known only in nearby lands.  
  - **5–6**: Regional — recognized as a notable hub or minor power.  
  - **7–8**: Widespread — respected or feared across multiple regions.  
  - **9–10**: Legendary — renowned across nations; center of myths or world affairs.  
- **Adjustment**:  
  - +1 after diplomatic successes, cultural achievements, or producing champions.  
  - -1 after humiliations, defeats, or isolation.  
- **Gameplay Effect**: Determines how much sway the community has in **regional politics, alliances, and cultural spread**.  

---

#### Rolling Challenges
When a community acts as a whole:  
- Roll **d20 + stat modifier** vs Difficulty Class (DC).  
- **Stat to Modifier Conversion**: See [Stat Modifiers](/Core%20Mechanics/stat-modifiers.md) for the full conversion table.
  - Stats 1-2 = -2 modifier
  - Stats 3-4 = -1 modifier  
  - Stats 5-6 = +0 modifier
  - Stats 7-8 = +2 modifier
  - Stats 9-10 = +3 modifier
- **Example**: *Community Prosperity 7* (modifier +2) rolls to recover from famine → d20 +2 vs DC 14.
